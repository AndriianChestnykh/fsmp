##File Storage Marketplace 
 ### Abstract

Main purpose of the system is to provide decentralized and secure disk space trading platform. The principle is free market between Data Owners (DO) who need disk space to store their files securely and Disk Space Owners (DSO) who rents their free disk space.  
Unlike centralized cloud storages like Dropbox or Google drive the system has Blockchain based data routing and payments. That means that there is no central authority who keeps your money or your data. Nobody except DO can read data. Nobody can switch DO or DSO off the system. All the data is securely encrypted by DO private key and is stored only in the DSO disk space.
Blockchain Smart Contracts keep cryptocurrency and make payments. They are supported by decentralized Ethereum Blockchain network.
All the parts of software are open-source.
