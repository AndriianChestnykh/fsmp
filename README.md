# Decentralized File Storage Marketplace 

Main purpose of the system is to provide decentralized and secure disk space trading platform. The principle is free market between Data Owners (DO) who need to rent disk space to store/backup their files securely and Disk Space Owners (DSO) who rent their disks, which are empty or not completely occupied with some data.

File Storage Marketplace is decentralized unlike traditional cloud storages. There is no single party, who controls DO and DSO cooperation in any possible aspect. 

## **Nobody except you can do the following**

* **Access your data**
* **Steal your payments**
* **Change cooperation/payment logic**
* **Switch you off the system**


All Data Owner data is securely encrypted by his/her encryption key and redundantly stored between different Data Storage Owners. Data Owner makes incentive for Data Storage Owners by his/her cryptocurrency payments through Smart Contract of public blockchains.
Our first (but not the only) public blockchain and cryptocurrency option is Ethereum platform.
